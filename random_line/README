I completed this programs using a pretty brute force approach. In my mind, the program was simple: generate a random number using the rand C++ function and when the file line matched that random number print it out. Well the program was just a bit more complicated than that. 
I broke the program into smaller parts, and solved each one by one and made sure it was working before I moved onto the next one. I first read in the file, then read in line of the file, then created a random number, then printed out that random line in the file. I of course ran into smaller problems within each one but was able to in the end build a successful program.
One problem I ran into was not being able to read from the same file twice. After a quick Google search I realized you need to reset the pointer to the head of the file if you wish to read from it again.
Overall this program is probably not the most efficient or fastest, but it works!
